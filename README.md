# Code-Quiz

# The application will test the user's knowledge on JavaScript fundamentals by administering a timed quiz.

# User high scores will be stored locally so that users can compare scores with their peers.

# Selecting incorrect answers during the quiz will reduce the amount of time left on the timer.

# The quiz is complete if either the timer runs or all the questions are answered, whichever comes first.
